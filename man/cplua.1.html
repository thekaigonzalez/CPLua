<h2>CPLUA(1) The "Lua Compiler Manual" CPLUA(1)</h2>

<h3><strong>NAME</strong></h3>

<pre>
    cplua - Compile and link Lua to an executable
</pre>

<h3><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>

<pre>
    cplua [file] [output-file] [working-directory]
</pre>

<h3><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>

<pre>
    `cplua` Runs a program which creates an executable which runs CPLua.extension in the <strong>directory(3)</strong>.
    If we run a command such as <em>cplua main.lua ./main.out ./</em>, it will create main.out and CPLua.extension
    in the working <strong>directory(3)</strong>.

    If CPLua.extension is not present, the program will fail to run since it was built using the CPLua.extension.
    The Working <strong>directory(3)</strong> must end with a <em>SLASH</em> in the format of a unix path, if not,
    The program is not 100% guaranteed to compile cleanly.

    Programs heavily rely on Lua headers being installed on the host system, If you don't have them, Please do

        sudo apt-get install lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev

    They contain headers required for the program to run.

    <strong style="color: #A00000">Linked Lua:</strong>
        Programs are hard-coded to be linked to a file called CPLua.extension with the exception of the
        working <strong>directory(3)</strong>.
        If CPLua.extension is not found, Then luaL_dofile() will print an error to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/stderr">stderr(3)</a>.

    Programs ARE NOT 100% guaranteed to be compiled cleanly, The required tools will higher the chances.
